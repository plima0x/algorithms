## What is it?

This is a list of common algorithms implemented in Python.

Each directory will have the following files:

**main.py**: The main file that contains the implementation of the algorithm.

**main_debug.py**: The file contains the same content of main.py, but with some debug messages.

**test_algorithm_name.py**: A test file with the name formed by the name test_ plus the algorithm name. It can be executed using pytest or simple python3 test_algorithm_name.py.
